exports[`chatgpt 1`] = `"Replacement text: The feature of modern front-end framework that I most appreciate is the utilization of a filesystem-based routing system. This makes defining routes significantly simpler. For example, with Next.js, one can define routes as such:  \\"./pages/index.tsx\\" corresponds to \\"/\\", \\"./pages/issues/index.tsx\\" corresponds to \\"/issues\\" and \\"./pages/issues/id/[id].tsx\\" corresponds to \\"/issues/id/:id\\". With the introduction of Node.js 12, a new feature called \\"condition-exports\\" was brought to the table, allowing developers to specify package subexports more easily. For instance, when using \\"lodash,\\" one may import an API in such a manner: \\"import {isObject} from 'lodash',\\" and Webpack will bundle all \\"lodash\\" APIs into the final bundle, reducing size by utilizing \\"babel-plugin-import.\\" A new tool, \\"rollup-plugin-condition-exports@next,\\" allows library developers to take advantage of this same pattern syntax. By default, files located in the \\"src/exports\\" folder will be set up in the \\"exports\\" field in the \\"package.json.\\" In addition, Node.js supports \\"condition-names,\\" meaning developers can define different APIs for both Node and browser sides. This is useful when one wants to maintain the same API between both sides, but with different behaviors. Finally, \\"rollup-plugin-condition-exports@next\\" has its own condition name convention; files named \\"node,\\" \\"browser\\" or \\"deno\\" are set up in different conditions.
